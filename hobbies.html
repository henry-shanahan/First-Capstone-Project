    <h1><u>Hobbies</u></h1>
    <p>My biggest interest is technology. I love learning new skills, so a lot of my free time is spent learning about Cyber Security, Networking, Web Development or Programming Languages. I am also passionate about food; creating recipes and exploring culinary techniques. I have successfully run a pop-up restaurant and actively shared my cooking on social media. Additionally, I prioritise health and fitness, engaging in activities such as tennis, climbing, and the gym. Travel is another key interest; I believe in immersing myself in different cultures and traditions. These hobbies not only fuel my creativity but also enhance my appreciation for diverse perspectives, which I find enriching both personally and professionally.</p>
